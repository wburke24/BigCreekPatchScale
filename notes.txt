- check if the shrub runs are good to keep
- from  janet email

init_conifer.awk - set for a def ID of 7 - for the overstory areas (cover fraction set to 0.6. gap fraction set to 0.1)
init_shrubs.awk - set for a def ID of 50 - for the shrub only areas (no forest overstory, i just set a no veg understory for shrubs)
init_understory.awk - set for a def ID of 51 - shrub understory under the conifer (cover fraction set to 0.6, gap fraction set to 0.0)
init_soil31.awk - def ID of 31, use for the areas that are forest overstory/shrub understory
init_soil32.awk - def ID of 32, use for the shrub only areas (that have no veg understory)

i'm sure you know this - but to apply to your worldfile:

awk -f init_conifer.awk < your_worldfile > over.world
awk -f init_understory.awk < over.world > over_under.world
